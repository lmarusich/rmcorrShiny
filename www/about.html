<h3>About this app</h3>
<p>This Shiny app computes and visualizes repeated measures correlation (rmcorr). Rmcorr is the common within-individual linear association for paired, repeated measures data.  Rmcorr is conceptually similar to a null multilevel model: A fixed slope and varying intercept by participant. For details about rmcorr and analyzing repeated measures data see below.</p>
