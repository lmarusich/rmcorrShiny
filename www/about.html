<h3>About this app</h3>
<p>This Shiny app computes and visualizes repeated measures correlation (rmcorr). Rmcorr is the common within-individual linear association for paired, repeated measures data.  Rmcorr is conceptually similar to a null multilevel model: A fixed slope and varying intercept by participant. For details about rmcorr and analyzing repeated measures data see below.</p>

<h4>Alternative to rmcorr: Resources for multilevel modeling</h3>
<p>Mulitlevel-modeling is a more complicated alternative to rmcorr, but multilevel modeling has capabilities that rmcorr does not. Multilevel modeling permits varying slopes whereas rmcorr <i>always</i> fits a common or fixed slope across participants. In addition, multilevel modeling can include additional variables (not just two dependent measures and participants) including more complex data structures (e.g., non-linear data, time-varying data, and more than two levels of nesting). See the <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00456/full">Journal Article for rmcorr</a> and references below more information.</p>
