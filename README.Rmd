# rmcorrShiny

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rmcorrShiny is to compute and visualize repeated measures correlation (rmcorr). Rmcorr is the common within-individual linear association for paired, repeated measures data. Rmcorr is conceptually similar to a null multilevel model: a fixed slope and varying intercept by participant.
