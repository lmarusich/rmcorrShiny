# rmcorrShiny

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rmcorrShiny is to compute and visualize repeated measures correlation (rmcorr). Rmcorr is the common within-individual linear association for paired, repeated measures data. Rmcorr is conceptually similar to a null multilevel model: a fixed slope and varying intercept by participant. 

## Getting Started

### 1. Web application
You can access and use rmcorrShiny at https://lmarusich.shinyapps.io/shiny_rmcorr/

### 2. R package
You can also install and run rmcorrShiny locally using the following code:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lmarusich/rmcorrShiny")
library(rmcorrShiny)
rmcorrShiny::rmcorrShiny_run()
```
