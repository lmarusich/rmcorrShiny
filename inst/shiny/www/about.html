<h3>About this app</h3>
<p>This Shiny app computes and visualizes repeated measures correlation (rmcorr). Rmcorr is the common within-individual linear association for paired, repeated measures data.  Rmcorr is conceptually similar to a null multilevel model: A fixed slope and varying intercept by participant. For details about rmcorr and analyzing repeated measures data see below.</p>

<h4>Alternative to rmcorr: Resources for multilevel modeling</h4>
<p>Mulitlevel modeling is a more complicated alternative to rmcorr, but multilevel modeling has capabilities that rmcorr does not. Multilevel modeling permits varying slopes whereas rmcorr <i>always</i> fits a common or fixed slope across participants.  We recommend using multilevel modeling if: there are more than two variables of interest (in addition to participants or subjects), data with more than two levels, simultaneous modeling of within and between-participants is needed, visual patterns patterns suggest varying slopes by individual and/or non-linear associations, and time need to be explicitly included in the model (i.e., modeling change over time as a separate variable. See the <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00456/full">Journal Article for rmcorr</a> and references below for more information.</p>
